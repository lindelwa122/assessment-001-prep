# Assessment Two Prep

Hey, it's Nqabenhle here. This is your assessment prep and it's meant to help you ace this upcoming assessment on Friday. I will try to cover everything you may need to know in a way that you will understand.

## The structure

This document includes three sections: functions, basic loops, and data (plus one extra one on algorithms). Each section has a quiz and also answers to check your knowledge. 

This *will* also include three mock tests to help you practice. They will all be made intentionally **hard**, but if you can get even 60% on them, you will ace the assessment on Friday.

## My philosophy on studying

I will start off by making a huge claim: *memorizing syntax doesn't help you become better at programming. I doubt that it will even help you pass the test.*

The reason I make this claim is that, memorizing syntax (*the how*) doesn't help you put your thoughts together and solve problems. You may know all of these building blocks but if you don't know how to put them together and build a functional structure, you still won't be able to pass assessments.

Instead learn what's possible in a language. Study all different things you can do with functions, loops, lists, and other concepts. Learn the *what*, and not focus so much on the *how*. 

Once you know the *what*, you will be able to bake up solutions to problem statements in your head by just looking at them. If you forgot a specific syntax you can always look it up and as you code more and more you will build a muscle memory for them.

**Note:** *Take this with a grain of salt and do what works for you.*
